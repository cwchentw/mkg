Installation
=============

``mkg`` is distributed as a single executable; hence, just download and move it
to a valid system executable path, i.e. whatever path in **PATH** variable. This
utility runs where Go (golang) compilers run, namely Windows, MacOS, GNU/Linux,
and FreeBSD.

*P.S. We didn't test our program on FreeBSD yet.*

If doubtful, check the source of ``mkg`` on either `GitHub <https://github.com/cwchentw/mkg>`_
or `GitLab <https://bitbucket.org/cwchen/mkg>`_. You may compile it from
its source as well, like this:

.. code-block:: console

   $ env GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=1 go get github.com/cwchentw/mkg

You need a recent Go compiler to compile ``mkg`` from its source.
